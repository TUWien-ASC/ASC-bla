Welcome to ASC-bla's documentation!
===================================

ASC-bla is a C++ library for basic linear algebra operations.
The library provides template classes **Vector** and **Matrix**.

Installation is via git-clone:

..  code-block::
    
    git clone https://github.com/TUWien-ASC/ASC-bla.git


To configure and build some tests do

..  code-block::

    cd ASC-bla
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    

To use ASC-bla in your code, set the compiler include path properly, and include the header files

..  code-block::

    #include <vector.h>
    #include <matrix.h>

All objects are implemented in the namespace ASC_bla. To use them with less typing, you can set

..  code-block::
    
    namespace bla = ASC_bla;

or even

..  code-block::
    
    using namespace ASC_bla;

    

You can create vectors and compute with vectors like:

..  code-block:: cpp
                 
   Vector<double> x(5), y(5), z(5);
   for (int i = 0; i < x.Size(); i++)
      x(i) = i;
   y = 5.0
   z = x+3*y;
   cout << "z = " << z << endl;


For matrices you can choose between row-major (`RowMajor`) or column-major (`ColMajor`) storage,
default is row-major.

..  code-block:: cpp

   Matrix<double,RowMajor> m1(5,3), m2(3,3);
   for (int i = 0; i < m1.Height(); i++)
     for (int j = 0; j < m1.Width(); j++)
       m1(i,j) = i+j;
   m2 = 3.7;
   Matrix product = m1 * m2;
   
You can extract a rows or a columns from a matrix:

..  code-block:: cpp

   Vector col1 = product.Col(1);
